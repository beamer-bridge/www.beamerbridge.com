        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information
          is collected, used, and shared by brainbot technologies AG.
          Personal Information means any information relating to an
          identified or identifiable natural person, who may be
          identified, directly or indirectly by reference to an
          identifier such as a name, an identification number,
          location data, online information (e.g. an IP address) or to
          one or more factors relating to that person. This notice
          applies to personal information provided to us by visitors
          to
          <a href="https://beamerbridge.com">https://beamerbridge.com</a>
          (the "website"), end users, beta testers, suppliers,
          contractors, job applicants, or other direct or indirect
          affected persons of the activities we carry out and
          functions we perform in running the website. In this notice
          "you" refers to any individual whose personal information we
          hold or process.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <strong>1. Basis on which we process personal data</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Personal Information we hold about you will be processed
          either because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the processing is necessary in pursuit of a "legitimate
            interest" (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR); a legitimate
            interest in this context means a valid interest we have or
            a third party has in processing your personal data which
            is not overridden by your interests in data privacy and
            security;
          </li>
          <li>
            you have consented to the processing for the specific
            purposes described in this notice (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a
            GDPR);
          </li>
          <li>
            the processing serves to fulfill a contract to which the
            data subject is a party or to carry out pre-contractual
            measures (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR); or
          </li>
          <li>
            the processing is necessary in order for us to comply with
            our obligations under a contract between you and us.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>2. Personal information we collect</strong></h2>
        <p>
          When you visit the website, we may automatically collect
          certain information about you and your device, including
          information about your web browser, IP address, time zone,
          and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.
          Additionally, as you browse the website, we may collect
          information about the individual web pages or products that
          you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the
          website, and information about how you interact with the
          website. We refer to this automatically-collected
          information as "Device Information." We collect Device
          Information using the following technologies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "Log files" track actions occurring on the website, and
            collect data including your IP address, browser type,
            Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and
            date/time stamps.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, if you sign up for a newsletter through the
          website, we collect your email address. We refer to this
          information as "Subscription Information." In the course of
          our interactions, we may also collect a record and details
          of any correspondence or communications between you and us
          relating to any information request or job application
          submitted to us. We refer to this information as
          "Communication Information". When we talk about "Personal
          Information" in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both
          about Device Information, Subscription Information and
          Communication Information.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <strong>3. How do we use your personal information?</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your Subscription Information will only be used to send you
          the subscribed newsletter by email. To receive the
          newsletter, it is sufficient to enter your email address.
          When you register to receive our newsletter, the data you
          provide will only be used for this purpose. Subscribers can
          also be informed via email about circumstances that are
          relevant to the service or registration (e.g. changes to the
          newsletter offer or technical conditions). For an effective
          registration, we need a valid email address. In order to
          check that a registration is actually made by the owner of
          an email address, we use the "double opt-in" procedure. For
          this purpose, we log the order of the newsletter, the
          sending of a confirmation email and the receipt of the
          response requested. Further data is not collected. The data
          will only be used for sending the newsletter and will not be
          passed on to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use or may use the Subscription Information regarding our
          other personalized services and Communication Information
          that we collect generally to communicate with you and to
          provide any other information you have requested or respond
          to any other correspondence. If you are registered with us,
          you can access content and services that we only offer to
          registered users. Registered users also have the option of
          changing or deleting the data provided when registering at
          any time. If users leave comments or forum posts on our
          website, the time of their creation and the user name
          previously selected by the user are saved in addition to
          this information. This serves our security as we can be
          prosecuted for illegal content on our website, even if it
          was created by users.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use the Device Information that we collect to help us
          screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP
          address), and more generally to improve and optimize our
          website (ensuring a problem-free connection to the website,
          evaluating system security and stability and for other
          administrative purposes). (This process is for our
          legitimate interests in managing the information we provide
          via our website and to assess how people use the website.)
          We do not use your Personal Information to draw conclusions
          about you personally. Personal Information may be
          statistically evaluated by us in order to optimize our
          website and the technology behind it.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>4. Sharing your personal information</strong></h2>
        <p>
          We share your personal information with third parties such
          as processors to help us use your personal information, as
          described above. We may disclose your personal information
          to other third-parties that enable us to provide the website
          and any connected services including technical support
          providers who may have access to personal data. These may
          include software and website developers, IT support and mail
          management service providers. In all cases, our agreement
          with the relevant third party will contain appropriate
          provisions regarding the use and security of your personal
          information. Finally, we may also share your personal
          information to comply with applicable laws and regulations,
          to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful
          request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect
          our rights.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>5. Do not track</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Please note that we do not alter our website's data
          collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track
          signal from your browser.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <strong>6. Transferring your information outside Europe</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          We will not transfer any data in a systematic way outside of
          the EEA but there may be circumstances in which certain
          personal information is transferred outside of the EEA, in
          particular:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            if you live outside of the EEA, we may communicate with
            you during the course of our interactions and such
            communications may include personal information (such as
            Subscription Information);
          </li>
          <li>
            we may have certain third-party service suppliers who are
            based outside the EEA or who store data outside of the
            EEA;
          </li>
          <li>
            if you communicate with us while you are outside of the
            EEA there may be some data transfer to you or your device;
          </li>
          <li>
            from time to time your information may be stored in
            devices which are used by affiliates engaged by brainbot
            technologies AG when outside of the EEA.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in a
          systematic way, and the third country or international
          organisation in question has not been deemed by the EU
          Commission to have adequate data protection laws, we will
          provide appropriate safeguards and your privacy rights will
          continue to be enforceable against us as outlined in this
          notice.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>7. Your rights</strong></h2>
        <p>
          In accordance with the GDPR and data protection laws
          applicable to you, the following rights may be available to
          you: The right (1) to be informed about our data processing
          activities (Art. 15 GDPR) (2) of access to the Personal
          Information we hold about you (Art. 15 GDPR) (3) to
          correction of your Personal Information if it is incomplete
          or inaccurate (Art. 16 GDPR) (4) to deletion of your
          Personal Information (Art. 17 GDPR) or (5) to restriction or
          limitation of the processing of your Personal Information
          (Art. 18 GDPR) and (6) to object to the processing of your
          Personal Information (Art. 21 GDPR) and (7) to receive
          copies of your Personal Information in a commonly used form
          and to transfer it directly to a third party (Art. 20 GDPR).
          If we are relying on your consent as the basis on which we
          are processing your Personal Information, you have the right
          at any time to withdraw your consent with future effect.
          Regarding your newsletter subscription, there is a
          corresponding link in every newsletter. You can also
          unsubscribe directly from this website at any time or inform
          us of your revocation. Any request made under (2) above (a
          subject access request) or any other notification in respect
          of your rights must be sent to us by post to: brainbot
          technologies AG, Taunusstraße 61, 55120 Mainz, Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are of the opinion that the brainbot technologies AG
          data processing activities infringe upon applicable data
          protection regulations or your personal data protection
          rights, you have the right to report this to the competent
          supervisory authority in Germany.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>8. Data retention</strong></h2>
        <p>
          If you sign up for a newsletter through the website or we
          acquire your personal information due to another interaction
          with brainbot technologies AG, we will generally maintain
          your personal information for our records for twelve months
          unless you ask us to delete this information before such
          time has passed. We may retain your personal information for
          more than twelve months if we consider it is necessary to
          enable us to satisfactorily provide the information on the
          website or administer the website or to enable us to comply
          with any statutory, legal or contractual obligation we may
          have. We review the personal information (and the categories
          of personal data) we are holding on a regular basis to
          ensure the data we are holding is still accurate and is
          still relevant to brainbot technologies AG and its website.
          If we discover that certain data we are holding is no longer
          necessary or accurate, we will take reasonable steps to
          correct or delete this data as may be required. Generally,
          personal information will be deleted as soon as it is no
          longer required for the purpose of the collection. Regarding
          Device Information, this is generally the case when the
          respective session has ended. The server log files will be
          deleted after 7 days.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>9. Security</strong></h2>
        <p>
          We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that appropriate
          technical and organisational measures are carried out in
          order to safeguard your personal information and protect
          against unlawful access and accidental loss or damage. These
          measures may include (as necessary):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            compliance with our internal IT security procedures;
          </li>
          <li>
            protecting our servers by both hardware and software
            firewalls;
          </li>
          <li>
            locating our data processing storage facilities in secure
            locations;
          </li>
          <li>
            using appropriate support tools and mailing list
            management providers;
          </li>
          <li>
            when necessary, disposing of or deleting your data in a
            secure manner; and
          </li>
          <li>
            regularly backing up and encrypting all data we hold.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will ensure that all contractors, staff or individuals
          engaged by us are aware of their privacy and data security
          obligations. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that
          the employees of third parties working on our behalf or
          providing services to us are aware of their privacy and data
          security obligations. Unfortunately, the transmission of
          information via the internet is not completely secure.
          Although we will do our best to protect your personal data,
          we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted by
          you to us by email. Once we have received your information,
          we will use the procedures and security features referred to
          in this Privacy Policy to try to prevent unauthorised
          access.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>10. Web analysis tool Matomo</strong></h2>
        <p>
          We analyze the use of our website with the open-source web
          analysis tool Matomo (formerly Piwik; data protection
          declaration can be found at
          <a href="https://matomo.org/privacy-policy/">https://matomo.org/privacy-policy/</a>). For this purpose, the
          automatically collected IP
          addresses are anonymized before the evaluation. The analysis
          is therefore based on anonymized data records and there is
          no personal evaluation. The web analysis is used exclusively
          to optimize the website in terms of user-friendliness and to
          provide useful information about our services. This data is
          not merged with other personal data sources or passed on to
          third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the data mentioned, Matomo also uses
          so-called "cookies" (see below).
        </p>
        <h2><strong>11. Cookies</strong></h2>
        <p>
          We use cookies on our website to make our offer
          user-friendly (Matomo, see above). Cookies are small files
          that your browser automatically creates and that are stored
          on your end device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when
          you visit our website. The cookies remain stored until you
          delete them. This enables us to recognize your browser the
          next time you visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not want this, you can set up your browser so that
          it informs you about the setting of cookies and allows them
          in individual cases. However, we would like to point out
          that deactivation means that you may not be able to use all
          functions of our website.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>12. Changes</strong></h2>
        <p>
          We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order
          to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for
          other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
